# Formal-Sys-Explorer
Formal Systems are a beautiful way of describing complex logical relationships from simple, often primitive rules and symbols.
They are considered by many to be at the very heart of mathematics, and the foundations of logic and knowledge. 

Formal Systems consist of just 4 main elements:
1. An alphabet - What symbols can you use to express statements?
2. Axioms - What statements are assumed to be true?
3. Rules - Given 1+ true statements, how does one get another true statement?
4. Grammar - How can these rules be encoded? 

The most well-known formal system is perhaps that of first-order logic and set theory. 
However, there are infinitely many more formal systems than that. 
This program provides an interface for the user to define and create formal systems, including 
all 4 elements stated above. 

The program is run as follows:
fsys [formal-system]

At the moment, all documentation for this program can be found in docstrings at the top of the code,
including the syntax to define a formal system.
